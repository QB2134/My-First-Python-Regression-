# Econometrics Assignment: Multiple Linear Regression

## Description
A Python Multiple Linear Regression I made using Python for my Econometrics assignment. May not be the cleanest code as it's my first ever coding project with Python.

## Project Overview
- **Analysis**: Multiple Linear Regression for Econometrics
- **Tools**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, statsmodels/scikit-learn
- **Purpose**: Academic assignment for Econometrics course

## Files
- `econometrics_regression.ipynb` - Main Jupyter notebook with the regression analysis and code.
- `requirements.txt` - List of Python packages required to run the notebook.

## Note
This is my first Python coding project, so the code may not follow all best practices. Learning as I go!
